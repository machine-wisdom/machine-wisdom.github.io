    Another contributor to the great success of machines to acquire
    wisdom is the innovation in Distributed Systems, spearheaded by
    Google since the early 2000s. Earlier I claimed that machines
    look into data and find patterns using very simple repetitive
    loops, crafted by humans to make the task mind numbingly simple.
    The strength point of machines is the speed by which they can attain
    this wisdom, specially if they are working together in a distributed system.
    This speed allows machines to go through Billions of observations in seconds,
    growing their collective conscious by an amount equivalent to the 
    growth of a human in several years of persistent studying.
    This scalability became possible because of a simplification
    of distributed systems that require algorithm programmers to be 
    even more crafty in developing their algorithms. For an algorithm
    to be scalable it has to be written in a way such that multiple
    worker machines can make progress independently, sharing nothing.
