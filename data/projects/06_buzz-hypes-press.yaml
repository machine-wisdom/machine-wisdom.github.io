  I intentionally use "machine wisdom applications"
  as if it is really something, in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. 
  I don't want to coin a term, but I also hope that you have found
  it as acceptable as "machine intelligence", "artificial intelligence",
  "machine cognition", or any other such terms that we learned to accept.
  I believe that "wisdom" is more accurate than "intelligence" for
  describing the cognitive capacity of machines, or rather the lack 
  thereof. I love artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, 
  statistical modeling, and whatever else you could call the 
  family of algorithms that leads to getting machines to do something
  that the programmer did not actually code. I don't care what 
  they are called as long as people realize they are just metaphors.
  It helps if people remember that all such algorithms can very
  easily fall into the pitfall of "over fitting" the training data,
  which renders what they learn useless when they are evaluated on 
  new data points. Much like a wise shaman who has never left the village,
  and while the wisdom is perfect for leading life in the village
  it is not generally applicable. The difference is that the shaman
  has intelligence and may be able to rectify the wisdom to be
  more applicable to different situations. On the other hand,
  we have not yet devised any machine learning algorithm that 
  can do this!
