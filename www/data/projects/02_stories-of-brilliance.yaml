    Humans continue to come up with all sorts of 
    objective functions,  loss functions, and learning algorithms
    which are suitable for different kinds of data. The brilliance
    of some humans make machines appear to be intelligent, like Alex Krizhevsky
    et al for example. In [2012](http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips25/NIPS2012_0534.pdf), 
    they came up with a way to get 
    machines to learn how to identify objects in pictures. 
    They used an algorithm called Neural Networks, but they did it
    in a way that will be later known as Deep Learning. They were not
    the first to do this, and they didn't coin the term Deep Learning;
    it is just a buzz word that is not well defined after all. The
    brilliance of their method IMHO was in the way they formulated the 
    problem to allow their machines to identify an object in a picture 
    with 10% more accuracy than the machines of the next best participant
    in the [ImageNet competition](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/supervision.pdf). 
    They did that by showing their machines the photos 10 times, and they didn't just
    show the machines the photos over and over -- they did something very
    smart. Each time, they showed the machine a different section of each
    photo, and some times they used a mirror image of the photo. 
    This allowed their machines to find patterns that generalize better,
    leading to their accuracy when asked about photos they hadn't seen 
    before. Of course, their use of a deep neural network is also brilliant,
    and their implementation was amazing craftsmanship. However, I believe 
    that their way of passing insights to the machines, through showing it the
    data many times, is pure mastery in the science of coaching machines. 
    Notice that they never showed the machines an upside
    down version of the photos, because this will not help in the task
    at hand, where images are already right-side-up.
