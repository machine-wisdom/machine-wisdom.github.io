    What do machines learn anyway? They learn whatever the programmer tells them
    they should find in the data. For example, if the programmer tells the machines that 
    there should be a straight line passing through the data points, then the 
    machines will go look for the best way to reconcile the data they see 
    with this claim. They will use a measure of success given to them, in the
    form of a loss function, and they will keep measuring how successful they 
    are in reconciling the data with the programmer's claim. 
    By using a convex optimization method, like Gradient Descent for example, 
    they work to minimize
    the loss function in order to make progress towards reconsiling the 
    programmers claim with the data at hand -- this is called model fitting. 
    Such dumb minions will never counter the programmer's claim by 
    proposing something else according to the data, even if the model 
    does not fit the data at all. They will always form a view of the world
    that is consistent with the programmer's claim even if the data doesn't
    fit at all, and they may not appear to be very intelligent when you ask
    them to make predictions!
