    I think of Machine Learning as a science of taming a wonderful 
    tool, to get it to do something amazing by repeating simple
    steps. The repetition and the faithfulness of the machines to 
    whatever the programmer tells them makes the process reminiscent 
    to the process of following a Zen-Master to achieve a wisdom of sorts.
    It is such a beautiful and romantic analogy, specially that 
    lots of programmers (myself included) would love to think of
    themselves as Zen-Masters. But, I'd rather get down to reality
    and call things with what they really are; it is a control system.
    Well, it is a very special one, because it is not grounded in 
    Control Theory. Actually, it seems that multiple disciplines
    have been approaching the same problem from different angles
    and they finally converged into a new science that is yet to be named.
