  Share nothing distributed systems are very scalable because they
  have no locks, so workers don't need to wait to acquire a shared
  resource. The first such system to become main stream is the 
  Map/Reduce processing framework, which was published by Google in a
  [2004 paper](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf)
  and then later adopted in the [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) open source
  project. The strength of Map/Reduce lies in how workers are spawned
  on the machines containing the data, thus reducing the need to move data 
  back and forth. More modern Map/Reduce frameworks like Apache Spark 
  reduces the disk and network I/O overhead even further, 
  specially for iterative workloads.
  This allows programmers to implement machine learning algorithms
  efficiently on Spark, shifting the role of the Hadoop eco-system
  from being more of a data preparation tool-set to being an end-to-end 
  toolbox for creating machine wisdom applications.
